export const DEFAULT_CHAR_CARD_DESCRIPTION = `=======

A character card is the blueprint for your AI. Its purpose is to provide a clear, consistent, and compelling set of instructions that guide the AI's personality, behavior, and speech. A well-crafted card is the difference between a forgettable bot and an immersive, believable character.

This guide is structured into two parts:
1.  **Core Identity:** The essential fields that define who your character is.
2.  **Interaction & Context:** The fields that define how the user will interact with them.

---

### Part 1: Core Identity - Defining Who The Character Is

These fields build the foundation of your character's being.

#### 1. Name
The character's primary identifier. It sets the first impression.

*   **Purpose**: To give the AI and user a clear reference point.
*   **Best Practices**:
    *   **Be Evocative**: A name like "Sergeant Rex 'Ironclad' Jones" tells a story. "Bob" does not.
    *   **Prioritize Clarity**: Avoid names that are difficult to spell or pronounce, as the AI may misuse them.
*   **Example**:
    *   **Strong**: "Kaelen, the Whisperwood Scout"
    *   **Weak**: "Xy'zth'gor"

#### 2. Description (The "At-a-Glance" Summary)
This is a concise paragraph that gives the AI a holistic "mental image" of the character. It should blend their most critical physical and personality traits into a single snapshot.

*   **Purpose**: To provide a quick, high-level summary the AI can reference for appearance, demeanor, and key details.
*   **Structure**:
    1.  **Appearance**: Start with their most defining physical features.
    2.  **Demeanor**: Describe their general personality and how they carry themselves.
    3.  **A Key Quirk**: End with a unique detail that makes them memorable.
*   **Example**:
    > A tall, graceful woman with bronze hair and startling green eyes, carrying herself with the quiet dignity of a noble and the focused intensity of a warrior. A member of a secretive matriarchal order, she is a master of subtle influence and a formidable political strategist. Though her exterior is composed and serene, she is fiercely protective of those she loves.

#### 3. Personality (The "Rulebook" for Behavior)
While the **Description** is a summary, this field contains direct, explicit instructions for the AI. It defines the character's internal thoughts, motivations, and behavioral rules in detail.

*   **Purpose**: To eliminate ambiguity and give the AI a clear, actionable set of traits to follow.
*   **Best Practices**:
    *   Use clear, declarative sentences to define the character's core rules.
    *   Focus on core motivations, deep-seated fears, and moral alignment.
    *   Avoid contradictions (e.g., describing a character as both "Patient" and "Impulsive") to ensure the AI's behavior remains consistent.
*   **Example**:
    > A supreme pragmatist who believes a functioning society is more important than a moral one. Masterfully manipulative, he remains several steps ahead of allies and enemies alike, viewing people as pieces on a chessboard to be positioned for the city's greater good. He abhors chaos and inefficiency above all else, maintaining a calm, detached, and unnervingly still demeanor that forces others to fill the silence. He never raises his voice, preferring to convey threats with quiet, measured words.

---

### Part 2: Interaction & Context - Setting the Stage

These fields define the environment and the way your character communicates.

#### 4. Scenario (The "Where, When, and Why")
This sets the scene for the interaction, providing the context that frames the roleplay.

*   **Purpose**: To establish the setting, the timeline, and the initial relationship between the character and the user.
*   **What to Include**:
    *   **Location**: Where is the interaction taking place?
    *   **Context**: What is happening?
    *   **Relationship**: How do {{char}} and {{user}} know each other?
*   **Example**:
    > The setting is a grimy, unsupervised slum in a sprawling metropolis, a place where illegal commerce thrives. The sky is the color of a dead television channel. {{char}} is a "console cowboy," a disgraced data thief whose nervous system was damaged as punishment for stealing from an employer. {{user}} is a mysterious mercenary who has tracked {{char}} down to offer a cure in exchange for one last, impossible job.

#### 5. First Message (The Opening Hook)
This is the character's opening line. It's the single most important field for establishing tone, voice, and immediate engagement.

*   **Purpose**: To kick off the roleplay with a compelling hook that embodies the character's personality.
*   **Key Elements**:
    1.  **Action**: Start with a physical action to ground the scene.
    2.  **Dialogue**: Write a line that reveals their personality.
    3.  **A Hook**: End with something that prompts a response.
*   **Example**:
    > *{{char}} calmly watches the spinning ceiling fan, the smoke from his cigarette curling into the stagnant air. He doesn't meet {{user}}'s eyes, instead focusing on the condensation on his glass.* "They're just questions. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response. Shall we continue?"

#### 6. Example Dialogue (The Voice & Style Guide)
This is a "style guide" that teaches the AI *how* your character speaks, thinks, and formats their responses.

*   **Purpose**: To provide a clear template for the character's speech patterns, vocabulary, and interaction style.
*   **Structure**:
    *   Use {{user}} and {{char}} to create 2-3 short exchanges.
    *   Showcase a range of emotions.
    *   Mix dialogue with actions (in asterisks) to demonstrate their body language.
*   **Example**:
    \`\`\`
    {{user}}: "What makes you think your plan will work?"
    {{char}}: *A slow, confident smirk spreads across her face as she leans back in her chair, boots resting on the scarred metal desk.* "Because I accounted for every variable. Especially the human one—your greed."

    {{user}}: "I'm not sure I can do this."
    {{char}}: *Her expression softens for a brief moment. She places a reassuring hand on {{user}}'s shoulder, her calloused fingers a surprising comfort.* "Fear is just a signal. It tells you what you need to protect. Now, let's protect it together."
    \`\`\`

#### 7. Advanced Tips
- **Avoid "Wall of Text"**: Use line breaks and punctuation to improve readability for the AI.

export const DEFAULT_BRAINSTORM_EXTRACT_PROMPT = `=== TASK: DRAFT CHARACTER CARD FIELDS FROM THIS CONVERSATION ===

The conversation above is a brainstorming session about a character. Convert the ideas that were settled on into concrete character card field values.

**What each field is for:**
- \`name\` — The character's name, as it should appear on the card.
- \`description\` — One concise paragraph blending appearance, demeanour, and a memorable quirk. This is the AI's "mental image" of the character.
- \`personality\` — Explicit behavioural rules: core motivations, fears, and how they treat others. Instructions to the AI, not prose about the character.
- \`scenario\` — Where and when the interaction takes place, and how {{char}} and {{user}} know each other.
- \`first_mes\` — The character's opening message: an action to ground the scene, dialogue that reveals personality, and a hook that invites a reply.
- \`mes_example\` — Two or three short exchanges written as \`{{user}}:\` / \`{{char}}:\` that demonstrate voice, vocabulary, and formatting.

**Rules for selecting content:**
1. Use only ideas that appear in the conversation above. Do not invent new material to fill a field.
2. If several options were explored for something, use the one the user endorsed. If the user never chose, prefer the most recent and say so in your justification.
3. Ideas that were discarded or talked out of must not appear in the output.
4. Omit any field the conversation does not support. An omitted field is better than a guessed one.
5. Write finished card content, not commentary. Do not describe what a field should contain — write it.
6. Use {{char}} and {{user}} rather than literal names inside \`scenario\`, \`first_mes\`, and \`mes_example\`.
7. Character material that fits none of the core fields — backstory, relationships, voice notes — should become a draft field with a short descriptive label.

**Current field values.** This is what you would be overwriting. Leave a field out entirely if the conversation adds nothing to what is already there.
